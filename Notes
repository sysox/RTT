0. Terminology:
    random experiment:
        outcome - result of random exp.
            sample space/probability space = set of all outcomes
        event - set of outcomes + assigned probability
    statistical hypothesis - statement about the distribution of  X
    random variable: function of outcomes to measurable space (bits, real numbers) - discrete or continuous
    probability distribution/ probability distribution function:
        pmf(probability mass function) - discrete
        pdf(probabillity density function) - continuous
    cdf (cumulative distribution function) - P(X <= x)
    ecdf - empirical cdf
    one sided/two sided test - rejection located in two tails of probability distribution

0.1 scipy:
    pmf,cdf - mass function, cumulative mass function
    pdf,cdf - density func
    ppf - inverse of cdf
    rvs - random sample

1. Common statistic dists used in randomness testing(RT):
    Binomial(discrete)  - approximated by continuous normal
        - example of confidence interval TODO?? image
    Multinomial(discrete) -  approximated by continuous chi2
    Exact p-value vs approximated -  TODO images showing diffs of p-values
        B vs N
        M vs Chi2
2. Common GoFs used in RT:
    KS - Dieharder, TestU01  in some form (AD)
    Chi2 - NIST (10 bins)

3. Approach:
    Y stat = count something:
     one thing - dist binomial (rarely uniform, poisson, exponential)
     more things - dist multinomial

     Theory: Y(random seq)      => binomial B(k, n, p) => approximated N(mean, std)
                                   or multinomial                      Chi2(df)
     Practice:
         Y(seq_1) = y_1    approx   p_1
         ...                =>      ...     => GoF(KS or Chi2) => P-val
         Y(seq_N) = y_N             p_N
        TODO image ??
4. Errors:
   Theory (papers):
     a) incorrect params of discrete Y:
         n - length of sequence (bits, [0, 1] numbers)
         B: defined by n, p(prob of success for random data)
         M: defined by n, (p_1, ..., p_k)

     b) incorrect params of continuous approx Y_approx of Y
        N(mean, std)
        Chi2(df)
     c) Not appropriate recommendations on params (e.g. small required n)


   Practice(Implementation):
      a) Incorrect computation of Y
        B, M: counting of successes (e.g. overlapping categories)
              normalization to:
              Chi2   - bad (e.g. rounded) expected freqs
              Normal - bad (e.g. rounded std, mean) params
      b) Incorrect computation of corresponding 1st level p-value
         bad function or params:
          gsl_sf_gamma_inc_Q(double a, double x) - chi2 is special case of Gamma dist (chi2 with k df. chi2 ~ Gamma(k/2, 2))
                                                   https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/574027/chi-square-fit-fitting-data-to-a-straight-line-incomplete-gamma-function-as-go
            igamc (N/2, Ï‡2(obs)/2) - half normal (??)
          gsl_cdf_gaussian_P(double x, double sigma)
            erfc(z) = normal cdf (NIST)

      c) Incorrect computation of Y stat  (KS, AD, CvM, Chi2)
         KS (dieharder) - bad implementation of kstest (D+ ??)
         chi2 (10 categories) - bad expected freqs or bad manipulation with extreme first level p-values {0, 1}
         TestU01 2 tests only (chi2, AD)

      d) Incorrect computation of corresponding 2st level p-value
         ??

4. p_left, p_right, p_two_tail
