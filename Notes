    0. Terminology:
        random experiment:
            outcome - result of random exp.
                sample space/probability space = set of all outcomes
            event - set of outcomes + assigned probability
        statistical hypothesis - statement about the distribution of  X
        random variable: function of outcomes to measurable space (bits, real numbers) - discrete or continuous
        probability distribution/ probability distribution function:
            pmf(probability mass function) - discrete
            pdf(probabillity density function) - continuous
        cdf (cumulative distribution function) - P(X <= x)
        ecdf - empirical cdf
        one sided/two sided test - rejection located in two tails of probability distribution

    0.1 scipy:
        pmf,cdf - mass function, cumulative mass function
        pdf,cdf - density func
        ppf - inverse of cdf
        rvs - random sample

    1. continuous - binomial, chi2 distribution
    2. discrete - normal, multinomial
    3. difference between (binomial - normal), (chi2, multinomial)
    4. p_left, p_right, p_two_tail
    5. alpha (sig. level), power(beta), confidence interval,
    6. KS, chi2 GoF for 1.-4. with different number of values (number of pvalues, )
