Experiments:
1. Are exact p-values OK = uniform? (How to measure uniformity).
   What if n is small and we use many p-values.
   B(n, p), M(n, p) - n = ?

   No sampling:
    p-values and probabilities
    chi2 - number of categories with minimal bias 10?

   Sampling: n = 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 10000
    KS -
    chi2 -

2.

Goal: how small bias of params can affect rejection.

    B vs N - difference of p-values
